create micDelayed more efficently


current Time - 81.328sec
After inlining calcDelayPts-Time=65.937s
After using vertcat & : for mDSilence, time=60s
removed col index from col vectors time=58s
made all vectors col vectors = 58s
can't use parfor - ints not adj.
inline bandpower as rms, time=50s
No real place to vectorize loops
could replace bmfpts as executable
